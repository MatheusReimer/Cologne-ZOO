## A few important informations of the project structure

The vue.js project structure is based on components. When developing a new feature, don't be afraid to create a new one or use the ones that were already created.

In this project we organize also the functions in a way that they can be reuse throughout the whole project in the folder of [composables](./composables).

In this project we also have an [assets](./assets) folder that are mainly static files like Images, video, other things that aren't code, markup, or configuration.

In this project we have a [server](./server) folder. This folder is used to organize the files that are related to having requests and responses to the application.

In this project we also have tests. Make sure to run or create a new test before completing your task.

In this project we use [storybook](./.storybook). According to the docs: Storybook is a tool for UI development. It makes development faster and easier by isolating components. This allows you to work on one component at a time. You can develop entire UIs without needing to start up a complex dev stack, force certain data into your database, or navigate around your application.

In this project we have also a main file that will run after the build is complete.That is: app.vue.
